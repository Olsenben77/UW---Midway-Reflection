# UW---Midway-Reflection - The Journey so Far

## What have you learned so far?

We have learned a lot in the past four months to say the least. Our class has covered numerous concepts and languages on the front and backend of website creation. We practiced organizing and setting up databases using MySQL and Sequelize. I had the opportunity to study Javascript and JQuery functions in depth and so much more! The material we have learned has given us a great beginner foundation to become successful future coders.

## What have you accomplished?

Four months ago, I came in as a person with no coding experience. Since then, I have accomplished learning numerous programming languages and being able to apply them to practical situations. I think for me the most important skill has been learning how to problem solve, which has been a constant in every unit. Knowing the basic syntax and methods is one thing, but being able to apply them in a way that can solve any issue that arises has made the most impact on me as a coder.

## Think back to the first week, how have you changed and grown since then?

To be honest, I was nieve in how much computer know-how I had at the beginning. This experience has made me humble in my coding knowledge but hungry for more information. I have learned to look at frustration as a learning curve rather than a hinderance. To go from no knowledge to creating full websites has given me a passion for this subject, which I know will help me grow as a coder as the weeks go by.

Path to Success

## What are your goals for the remainder of the course?

For the remainder of the course, I would like to spend more time practicing the materials and prepping for interviews. I definitely need more experience with JavaScript functions, and so I hope to try backend coding more to help get me out of my comfort zone. Also, utilizing the preclass drills and reviewing those after class is an important goal.

## What do you hope to accomplish before the course completes?

Before the course completes, I would like to attempt a mock interview. I would also feel more comfortable with my place in the class, by reviewing all of the languages and concepts we have leanred. Making the most of my time in class and making sure I am employer ready is my biggest hope.

## What do you hope to accomplish after the course completes?

After the course completes, I plan on taking a short class on computer scinece to refine my programming abilities. My main hope is within six months of completing the course, to land a junior web development job. I know the market is competitive, so this will require some practice and tutoring on my end. But this has been the goal from the beginning and at least now I know what I need to do to accomplish this.

## What do you plan to do to ensure you accomplish these goals?

Practicing the material and making the most of my time during this bootcamp will be the most essential parts. I also think, setting up a schedule for myself of continuing to code everyday even after camp will help me out. Any networking or further practice opportunities I find will be useful.

## How do these plans and goals differ from the first half of the course?

During the first half of the course, I was under the impression that the bootcamp would land you employment after the course had finished. Now I know that we are given the tools to become employer ready but more work needs to be done on our end. I now am beginning to understand the importance of practice and networking in this field. This have become bigger priorities for me, and I am happy to have a great instructor and group of TA's to help me on my way.
